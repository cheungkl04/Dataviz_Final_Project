# Vancouver, Canada has always been ranked in the top 5 best places to live in the world. 
# Thus, many people around the world made it their goal to move to Vancouver. With population growth, pressure is put onto housing and prices are driven upwards due to limited supply of land. As a result, many young people do struggle to find affordable housing in the city. Thus, I've created a map showing where the majority of the growth occurs, as well as the density of young people within the city limit.

# The map below shows population growth in the city from 2001 to 2011.

# All data was obtained online through the City of Vancouver website. Their file names are: CensusLocalAreaProfile2001.xls, CensusLocalAreaProfile2006.xls, and CensusLocalAreaProfile2011.xls. Thus, you can download the data and make your own charts and maps!
# What I've learned from this course: Skills in searching for data, best methods to display (visualize) the data, learning about geojson, leaflet, github, Google Sheets, etc and how all these play together in terms of data visualization and open source mapping.
