# Vancouver has ranked consistently in the top 5 best places to live in the world.
# Thus, many young people around the world move to Vancouver for school, work, working holiday, migration, and various other reasons. 
# As a result, we want to know where the young people are living. Thus, I've created a map showing where the highest population growth has been in the last 10 years, along with a chart showing the age composition of each neighbourhoods in the city.

# The map below shows population growth in the city from 2001 to 2011.

# From this map, we can see the downtown peninsula had the highest population growth within city proper (27,990	in 2001 to 43,415 in 2006, to	54,690 in 2011).

# Grandview-woodland has the biggest population declinde from 2001 to 2011 (29,085 in 2001, to	28,205 in 2006, then	27,305 in 2011).
# Shaughnessy, the historical neighbourhood for the wealthy, is also in decline in terms of population from 2001 to 2011.

# The chart will show the various neighbourhoods in the city and the composition of age demographics.

# All data was obtained online through the City of Vancouver website. Their file names are: CensusLocalAreaProfile2001.xls, CensusLocalAreaProfile2006.xls, and CensusLocalAreaProfile2011.xls. Thus, you can download the data and make your own charts and maps!
# The Vancouver local census is expected to be released in the 3rd quarter of 2017.

# What I've learned from this course: Skills in searching for data, best methods to display (visualize) the data, learning about geojson, leaflet, github, Google Sheets, etc and how all these play together in terms of data visualization and open source mapping.
