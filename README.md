# Vancouver, Canada has always been ranked in the top 5 best places to live in the world. 
# Thus, many young people around the world move to Vancouver for school, work, working holiday, migration, and many other reasons. 
# As a result, we want to know where the young people are living. Thus, I've created a map showing where the highest population growth has been in the last 10 years, along with a chart showing the age composition of each neighbourhoods in the city.

# The map below shows population growth in the city from 2001 to 2011.

# All data was obtained online through the City of Vancouver website. Their file names are: CensusLocalAreaProfile2001.xls, CensusLocalAreaProfile2006.xls, and CensusLocalAreaProfile2011.xls. Thus, you can download the data and make your own charts and maps!
# What I've learned from this course: Skills in searching for data, best methods to display (visualize) the data, learning about geojson, leaflet, github, Google Sheets, etc and how all these play together in terms of data visualization and open source mapping.
