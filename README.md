# For numerous of years, Vancouver has been ranked in the top 5 best places to live in the world. As a result, this triggered many interest from people around the world (including people from other provinces) to migrate to Vancouver and live. Many people around the world move to Vancouver for school, work, working holiday, migration, and various other reasons. As a result, we're seeing many parts of the city being redeveloped into higher density condominiums.
# With a limited land supply and an increase of demand, along with slow pace of development approval process, the price of the land has gone up. With one of the slowest rise in provincial minimum and average wage in Canada, Vancouver has become less affordable, especially for the younger demographics. This would mean people are paying longer mortgages and living in smaller spaces.
# I wanted to find out which neighbourhood are people moving into and moving out of. Thus, I've created a map showing where the highest population growth has been in the last 10 years, along with a charts showing the age composition of neighbourhoods in the city. I've also added a scatter plot of the median age and average dwelling values in various neighbourhoods. 
# This could be helpful in determining which neighbourhoods will need support infrastructure for young families (daycare facilities, schools, and such). Also, to determine which areas are out of reach for people to move into, thus resulting negative population growth, along with aging population in terms of median age. Urban planners should consider rezoning opportunities for higher density development but making sure numerous housing types to balance population growth, affordability, characteristics, and integrity of the neighbourhoods to keep the quality of life to a high standards.

# Grandview-woodland has the biggest population decline from 2001 to 2011 (29,085 in 2001, to	28,205 in 2006, then	27,305 in 2011).
# Shaughnessy, the historical neighbourhood for the wealthy, is also in decline in terms of population from 2001 to 2011.

# All data was obtained online through the City of Vancouver website. Their file names are: CensusLocalAreaProfile2001.xls, CensusLocalAreaProfile2006.xls, and CensusLocalAreaProfile2011.xls. Thus, you can download the data and make your own charts and maps!
# The 2016 Vancouver local census is expected to be released in the 3rd quarter of 2017.

# What I've learned from this course: Skills in searching for data, best methods to display (visualize) the data, learning about geojson, leaflet, github, Google Sheets, etc and how all these play together in terms of data visualization and open source mapping.
